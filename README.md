## Overview

The Robot Programming Control class is aimed at individuals interested in learning how to program and control robots. The course covers essential topics such as kinematics, dynamics, trajectory planning, and feedback control. It also introduces programming languages and frameworks commonly used in robotics, such as ROS (Robot Operating System) and Python.

In this repository, you will find lecture slides, code examples, and additional resources to support your learning journey. The materials are organized into different modules, each focusing on specific topics and concepts. Feel free to explore the repository and follow the instructions provided in the respective modules.

## Requirements

To follow the class and execute the code examples, you will need the following:

- A computer running a compatible operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Python programming language (version X.X or later)
- [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://www.ros.org/) (version X.X or later)

Please refer to the official documentation for each software/tool to ensure you have the latest versions and appropriate setup instructions.
